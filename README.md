# Horiseon Marketing

## Editing
Using HTML and CSS, I updated Horiseon's webpage to have greater accessibility so that it would be best optimized in search engines and easier to navigate for those using assistive tech. I created new semantic elements and organized the CSS to fit to those changes. I added alt attributes to act as captions for assistive tech or if the image just won't load. I also gave the webpage a title so that people know what they are naviagting to before clicking on the page.
